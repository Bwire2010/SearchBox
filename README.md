## Frontend Deployment

The frontend of this application is deployed at [https://bwire2010.github.io/Searchbox-Frontend/](https://bwire2010.github.io/Searchbox-Frontend/). You can access and interact with the live application through this link.

## Backend Deployment

The backend of the application is deployed at [https://searchbox-005p.onrender.com/searches](https://searchbox-005p.onrender.com/searches). This is where the backend API endpoints are hosted.

## Ruby Version

This project is developed using Ruby version 3.3.0. Ensure that you have the correct Ruby version installed on your system.

## System Dependencies

The system dependencies for this project are managed using Rails, version 7.0.8. Ensure that Rails is installed on your machine before proceeding.


gem install rails -v 7.0.8

## Follow these steps to get the application up and running:

1. Clone the repository:

## 6. Usage Example

The search engine is designed to capture complete searches and filter out incomplete ones. Here's an example:

1. **User Searches (because itâ€™s instant, it records it all):**

   - (1st (random) user searches for)
     - What is
     - What is a
     - What is a good car

   - (2nd (random) user searches for:)
     - How is
     - How is emil hajric
     - How is emil hajric doing

2. **Your search engine only records:**
   - What is a good car
   - How is emil hajric doing

And removes the rest because it was an incomplete search.

## Tests

This project includes a suite of RSpec tests to ensure the proper functionality of the `SearchesController`. To run the tests, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bundle exec rspec

The tests cover the following scenarios:

1. **Creating a new search and removing similar queries:**
   - *Description:* Tests whether a new search is created and similar queries are removed when the query is new and more complete.
   - *Command:* `bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/searches_controller_spec.rb:9`

2. **Not creating a new search for incomplete queries:**
   - *Description:* Verifies that incomplete queries do not result in a new search being created.
   - *Command:* `bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/searches_controller_spec.rb:21`

3. **Fetching recent searches for the current user:**
   - *Description:* Ensures that recent searches for the current user are fetched correctly.
   - *Command:* `bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/searches_controller_spec.rb:31`

4. **Not recording incomplete searches:**
   - *Description:* Confirms that incomplete searches are not recorded.
   - *Command:* `bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/searches_controller_spec.rb:41`

Run the tests regularly to ensure continued functionality as the project evolves.
